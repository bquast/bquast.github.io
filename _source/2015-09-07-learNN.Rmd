The [learNN package ](http://cran.r-project.org/package=learNN) makes it easy to become familiar with the way neural networks work.

The package is based on previous post on this blog.

Andrew Trask wrote an amazing post at [I am Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) called:

> [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)

In the post [Hand Coding a Neural Network](/handcoding-neural-network) I've translated the Python code into R.

In a follow up post called:

> [A Neural Network in 13 lines of Python](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/27/python-network-part2/)

Andrew shows how to improve the network with optimisation through gradient descent.

In previous post I've translated this code to R.
