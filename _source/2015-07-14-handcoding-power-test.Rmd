We want to test if our population average is different from twenty.

We therefore specify the follow zero hypothesis.

$$
H_0: \mu = 20
$$

The alternative hypothesis is

$$
H_a: \mu \neq 20
$$


Accepting   


```{r}
mu <- 40
sd <- 8
n  <- 20 
ci <- qnorm(0.975)*sd/sqrt(n)
(left <- mu - ci)
(right <- mu + ci)
```
