Together with the **KoBo Toolbox** designers from the **Harvard Humanitarian Initiative**,
we (with [Cogtina](http://coginta.org/)) conducted a baseline study in **Conakry** (Guinea) as part of a [police reform project called **police de proximite**](http://www.coginta.org/uploads/documents/16054bef85057f42b00451190c0b6cc5effbab38.pdf).

Also, with Coginta, conducted a [security and police perceptions study](http://www.geneve.ch/police/doc/statistiques/diagnostic-local-securite-2013.pdf) (in French) together with the Geneva police.

Also working on an [**impact evaluation**](https://github.com/bquast/Gender-Child-Growth) of the lowering of
the male **state-pension eligibiliy age** in **South Africa** (from 65 to 60),
on the **anthropometrics of young** children in the same household.
In particular with regard to the **gender** of the pension recipient.
