Has no musical talent or rhythm in general.
Would like to be better at programming, but generally to disorganised to be good at it.
Reasonably good with **Linux**, **R** and **LaTeX**.

Has a working (but as of yet unsubmitted) [R package called decompr](https://github.com/bquast/decompr),
which applies the **Wang-Wei-Zhu** and **Kung-Fu** algorithms for **export decomposition**.

Together with the **KoBo Toolbox** designers from the **Harvard Humanitarian Initiative**,
we (with [Cogtina](http://coginta.org/)) conducted a baseline study in **Conakry** (Guinea) as part of a [police reform project called **police de proximite**](http://www.coginta.org/uploads/documents/16054bef85057f42b00451190c0b6cc5effbab38.pdf).

Also, with Coginta, conducted a [security and police perceptions study](http://www.geneve.ch/police/doc/statistiques/diagnostic-local-securite-2013.pdf) (in French) together with the Geneva police.

Also working on an [**impact evaluation**](https://github.com/bquast/Gender-Child-Growth) of the lowering of
the male **state-pension eligibiliy age** in **South Africa** (from 65 to 60),
on the **anthropometrics of young** children in the same household.
In particular with regard to the **gender** of the pension recipient.

Sometimes working on a [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/KoBo_Toolbox) on the [Kobo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/),
which is an open-source survey software suite (android) designed for conditions with limited access to internet, electricity, etc.

Would like to work on **Bitcoin** and its role in development economics. Particularly in connecting one of Bitcoin's great potentials - remittances - with a home-grown developing-world technological-innovation: mobile banking.
