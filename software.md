I have developed the R packages [decompr](https://qua.st/decompr) ([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decompr/)) and gvc ([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gvc/index.html)) which can be used for the **Wang-Wei-Zhu** and **Leontief decomposition** algorithms and futher analysis of Global Value chains.
