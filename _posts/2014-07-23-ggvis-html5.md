[Sepal-Modeling](http://bquast.shinyapps.io/Iris-App) is a **shiny app**,
which uses **ggvis** to fit LOESS smoothers on the sepal ratios of the **iris** dataset.
There are separate smoothers  for every species, as well as a general smoother for all observations.
The span can be adjusted in order to see if we need to model the sepal ratio per species or jointly.

There is also an [HTML5 **dynamic** presentation](http://bquast.shinyapps.io/Iris-Presentation)
and a [HTML5 **static** presentation](http://bquast.github.io/Iris-Presentation), both build using **rmarkdown v2**.
