The `rnn` `R` package, describing how to implement from scratch the [Recurrent Neural Network algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) in the [R language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnn).

The `rnn` package can be installed simply from within `R` by running:
```
install.packages('rnn')
```

It does not have any dependencies, `C++`, `Fortran`, `Java`, or any other type of complexities. It is written purely in `base` `R`, so it should install without any issue on any R version.

Following installation, you can load the package using:
```
library(rnn)
```

The package contains five `HTML` vignettes: 

 1. Basic Recurrent Neural Network
 2. Recurrent Neural Network
 3. RNN units
 4. Sinus and Cosinus
 5. GRU units
 6. LSTM units


The suggested way to work through the vignettes in this increasing order of complexity. You can load the first vignette (after installing and loading the package as described above) using:
```
vignette('Basic Recurrent Neural Netowrk')
```

After having worked through the vignette, you can then dive a bit deeper into the same example with `Recurrent Neural Netowrk` using:

```
vignette('Recurrent Neural Netowrk')
```

## Wikipedia Article
You can find more information on the [Wikipedia article]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rnn_(software)

## Development
Development takes place on GitHub:

<https://github.com/bquast/rnn>

The *development* version, to be used *at your peril*, can be installed from GitHub using the `remotes` package:

```
if (!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('bquast/rnn')
```

## Bugs
You can also file any bugs reports there:

The code is based to a large extent on last week's post: [Self-rnn from Scratch in R](/rnn-in-R).
