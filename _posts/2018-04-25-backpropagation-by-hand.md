> doing backpropagation using pen and paper

We begin with a simple problem, we have two guys, Joris and Carl, who both want to be tall.

Joris is dutch and so he drinks a pint of milk a day, so that he may grow tall.

Carl is Swedish and so he eat meatballs with jam to grow tall.

We can represent this in a matrix: `[[1,0],[0,1]]`.
