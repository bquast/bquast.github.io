As Friday was a holiday in Switzerland, my girlfriend and I decided to go to Paris for the weekend.
Besides a covoiturage (car share) and AirBnB,
we used the Parisian bike share program called [VÃ©lib'](http://www.velib.paris) (.paris? very quick adoption),
which is a contraction of **vel**o, meaning bicycle and **lib**re, which means free as in **free speech**.

From an economic perspective, there are many interesting innovations about modern bike share programs.
In terms of capital resources sitting idle, bike share programs are a major leap forward from each person owning their own bike.
I bike to work and back every day, but between those trip my bike sits idily and often somewhat in the way.

Perhaps more important than capital resources sitting idle,
is the greater opportunity and lower threshold to using a bike share bike.
The greater opportunity comes from always having a bike at your disposal,
rather than only when you are close to where you left your bike.
The lower threshold is caused by the lower commitment in taking the bike somewhere,
as you can simply dock it at your destination without having to worry about having to take it home.
This comes in particularly handy when you are going on a night out
and want to keep open the option of taking a taxi home
(in light of the 'new economy' theme of this this post, that would be an Uber taxi of course).

There are of course trends which cause local shortages at certain times.
In the morning many people take the bike from residential areas to business districts,
and in the evening the reverse happens.
In the morning this causes a shortage of bikes in the residential area
and a shortage of docking stations in the business districts and visa versa in the evening.

The development economics perspective in particular ..

In addition to this there many social welfare advantages to this, such as the fitness effects.
