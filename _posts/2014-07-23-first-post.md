The purpose of this blog is to list output from my day-to-day work.
My work mainly consists of tinkering with R.
I am a 27 year old PhD Candidate in Development Economics at The Graduate Institute in Geneva,
where I am also working as a research assistant at the Centre for Finance and Development
as well as at the Centre on Conflict Development and Peacebuilding.

Thematically my work in on development economics, which generally employs microeconomic and microeconometric methodology.
From a more applied methodological perspective, I focus on reproducability.
That is to say, I try make my work replicable and transparent.
At the surface, this is done by documenting my research and data, and publishing this.
Slightly less on the surface, version control is useful to enable possible reproductions
to retrace the entire research process.
Finally, using open-source software such as R and Git enables reproducers to understand
and verify the implmentations of the mathematical and statistical algorithms employed.

After all this noble talk of reproducability I should of course point out that at this point I have exactly zero published papers,
let alone people trying replicate my work.
