In [yesterday's post](/replicable-development-economics) I discussed some of the principles I use to make my work replicable and - to an extend - reproducible.
In this post I want to collect some resources which I think will be very helpful in getting a grasp of the basics of R and Git.

R
----------------------
An easy way to start with R without having to install it is using the online tutorial
[Try R by Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).

After you have completed this tutorial, have a look at the [Datacamp R tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/).

If want try an learn something about R on the go, you might want to have a look at [R instructor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_RInstructor.R2) (Android).

If you are on iOS, there is
[an implementation of the R programming language](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r-programming-language/id540809637),
which will give you the ability to run R on your iOS device.

If you have internet access but do not hav R installed, then you might want to try [R fiddle](http://www.r-fiddle.org/), which gives you an online (mobile friendly) environment to execute R code.

Git
---------------------------------
An easy way to start with Git without having to install it using the online tuturial
[Try Git by Code School](https://try.github.io/) (notice that this site is hosted on Github pages).

After having completed this tutorial, you might want to have a look at this cool [Git Branching Game](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/),
which will really cement your understanding what control is and how to use Git to manage it.

Delving into the belly of the beast
--------------------------------------
On a day to day basis, you will not need more than a few git commands.
Once you have mastered the basics,
there is not that much more to learn which will be useful for you analysis.

With R however, it is a different story altogether, R is both much more expansive,
as well as constantly evolving.
For this reason I am adding a few more resources which might come in handy for acquiring a deeper understanding of R.

John D. Cook also has a guide called [R programming for those coming from other languages](http://www.johndcook.com/R_language_for_programmers.html).

Once you have become quite familiar with R and want to really learn some more fundamental topics, then have a look at [Hadley Wickam](http://had.co.nz/)'s [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).
