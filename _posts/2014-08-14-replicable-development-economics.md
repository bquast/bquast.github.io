The tagline of this blog says something **replicable development economics using R and git**.
So far, I have posted gimicks on new R tools such as shiny, rmarkdown, and my own package.
Also, I have posted on how to use Git, Github, and Jekyll to write a website/blog.
However, I have never brought the two together and how this features into creating replicable research.

In this post I will briefly describe what Git and R are, and how I use them for my work. I hope to post something tomorrow about useful resources for mastering both these tools.

First and foremost, R. Like so many statistical / computational tools, R is essentially two things. Firstly, it is a computer program which executes computations. Secondly, and perhaps more relevant for day to day use, R is a language for programming in this program. In effect, R is a computer program on your computer, but the R language is lines of code which are interpreted by this program.

Secondly, Git. Git is a version control software, it was written by Linus Torvalds, who also wrote the Linux kernel (basis of the operating system).
