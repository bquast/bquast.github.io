A new R package **gvc** is now available on CRAN.
The package implements several **global value chain** indicators

- Importing to Export (`i2e()`, a.k.a. vertical specialization)
- Exporting to Re-export (`e2r()`)
- New Revealed Comparative Advantage (`nrca()`)

As well as several other tools.

The **gvc** package can now be install directly from **R** using:

{% highlight r linenos %}
install.packages("gvc")
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to this, a **development version** is available on GitHub, this version is to be used **at your own risk**, it can be install using:

{% highlight r linenos %}
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("bquast/gvc")
{% endhighlight %}

More updates on both the **decompr** and **gvc** packges will follow soon.
