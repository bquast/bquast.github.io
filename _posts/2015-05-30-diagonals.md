A new R package **diagonals** is now available on CRAN. The package implements several tools for dealing with **fat diagonals** on matrices.

- `block_matrix()`
- `minu_block_matrix()`
- `rectangle_matrix()`
- `minus_rectangle_matrix()`

The **diagonals** package can now be install directly from **R** using:

    install.packages("diagonals")
