A typical example in which `diagonals` can be helpful is Social Network
Analysis. For example, if we use matrices to represent friendship
perceptions between individuals, then we need a dyadic matrix.

    # generate a dyadic matrix for 3 individuals
    m <- matrix(sample(0:1, 9, replace=TRUE), nrow=3, ncol=3)
    m

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
    ## [1,]    1    0    1
    ## [2,]    0    1    1
    ## [3,]    0    0    1

Let says that we want to look at second-order connections (i.e. friends
of friends). If we now want to represent the data from both time period
in a single object, we need a 4-dimensional array. Higher-order arrays
are hard to visualise, another way of doing this is by representing two
dimensions along each of the two edges of a matrix. We can do this using
the **Knonecker Product** (denoted âŠ—), which we can call in `R` using
the alias `%x%`.

    M <- m %x% m
    M

    ##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
    ##  [1,]    1    0    1    0    0    0    1    0    1
    ##  [2,]    0    1    1    0    0    0    0    1    1
    ##  [3,]    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0    1
    ##  [4,]    0    0    0    1    0    1    1    0    1
    ##  [5,]    0    0    0    0    1    1    0    1    1
    ##  [6,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    0    1
    ##  [7,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    1
    ##  [8,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    1
    ##  [9,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1

Feelings of friendship towards oneself aren't always particularly
insightful. We can now use the `diagonals` library to eliminate those.

    # load the library
    library(diagonals)

    # remove the elements along the diagonal of width 2
    minus_block_matrix(M, size=2)

    ## Warning in minus_block_matrix(M, size = 2): Matrix dimensions are not a
    ## multiple of size, problems will occur in the bottom right (South-East) of
    ## the output matrix.

    ##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
    ##  [1,]    0    0    1    0    0    0    1    0    1
    ##  [2,]    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    1    1
    ##  [3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1
    ##  [4,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    1    0    1
    ##  [5,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    1
    ##  [6,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1
    ##  [7,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1
    ##  [8,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1
    ##  [9,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1


The [diagonals](http://cran.r-project.org/?package=diagonals) package now [available on CRAN](/diagonals-cran) and can therefore be install directly from inside `R` using:

    install.packages("diagonals")

Subsequently the package can be loaded using:

    library(diagonals)
    
The above demonstration is also available as a vignette that is [included in the package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diagonals/vignettes/network.html).
It can be accessed from `R` using:

    vignette("network")

A general introduction to `diagonals` is available in next weeks post: [diagonals](/diagonals). This post is also available as a vignette that is [included in the package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diagonals/vignettes/diagonals.html)

For more information on the package and its development please see yesterday's post [diagonals on CRAN](/diagonals-cran).
