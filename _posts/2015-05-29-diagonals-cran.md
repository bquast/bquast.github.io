Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed using two small functions implemented here, in addition, non-square matrices are supported.

Block diagonal matrices occur when we combine two dimensions of a data set along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the [decompr](http://cran.r-project.org/?package=decompr) and [gvc](http://cran.r-project.org/?package=gvc) package have each country-industry combination occur on each edge of the matrix.

The stable version of the `diagonals` package can be install from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) using:

    install.packages("diagonals")

The development version, to be used **at your peril**, can be installed using:

    if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
    devtools::install_github("bquast/decompr")

Following installation, the package can be loaded using:

    library(diagonals)
