I am currently working on the second phase field study of the impact of the
[Initiative Nationale pour le DÃ©veloppement Humain (Moroccan National Initiative for Human Development)](http://www.indh.gov.ma/index.php/en/)
on social cohesion in supported communes.
Together with [CFD Director](http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/research/centresandprogrammes/cfd.html)
[Jean-Louis Arcand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Arcand),
[Mattias Rieger](http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/MaxWeberProgramme/People/MaxWeberFellows/Fellows2013-2014/Rieger.aspx),
and Tu Chi Nguyen (The World Bank, no profile, internally known as t.c.nguyen17, [funny TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz4aom2cYUw)).

Previously
-------------------
Together with the **KoBo Toolbox** designers from the **Harvard Humanitarian Initiative**,
we (with [Cogtina](http://coginta.org/)) conducted a baseline study in **Conakry** (Guinea) as part of a [police reform project called **police de proximite**](http://www.coginta.org/uploads/documents/16054bef85057f42b00451190c0b6cc5effbab38.pdf).

Also, with Coginta, conducted a [security and police perceptions study](http://www.geneve.ch/police/doc/statistiques/diagnostic-local-securite-2013.pdf) (in French) together with the Geneva police.

Also working on an [**impact evaluation**](https://github.com/bquast/Gender-Child-Growth) of the lowering of
the male **state-pension eligibiliy age** in **South Africa** (from 65 to 60),
on the **anthropometrics of young** children in the same household.
In particular with regard to the **gender** of the pension recipient.
