decompr: Global Value Chain decomposition in R
----------------------------------------------
by Bastiaan Quast and Viktor Kummritz

Global Value Chains have become a central unit of analysis in research on
international trade. However, the complex matrix transformations at the basis of most
Value Chain indicators still constitute a significant entry barrier to the field. The R
package decompr solves this problem by implementing the algorithms for the analysis
of Global Value Chains as R procedures, thereby simplifying the decomposition
process. Two methods for gross export flow decomposition using Inter-Country
Input-Output tables are provided. The first method concerns a decomposition based
on the classical Leontief (1936) insight. It derives the value added origins of an
industry's exports by source country and source industry, using easily available gross
trade data. The second method is the Wang-Wei-Zhu algorithm, which splits bilateral
gross exports into 16 value added components. These components can broadly be
divided into domestic and foreign value added in exports. Using the results of the two
decompositions, decompr provides a set of Global Value Chain indicators, such as the
now standard Vertical Specialisation ratio. This article summarises the methodology
of the algorithms, describes the format of the input and output data, and exemplifies
the usefulness of the two methods on the basis of a simple example data set.
